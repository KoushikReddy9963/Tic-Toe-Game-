# Tic - Toe Game

I've crafted a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players enjoy a responsive interface, placing Xs and Os .

JavaScript powers the game's logic seamlessly. 

This project demonstrates my adeptness in front-end development and JavaScript programming, blending these tools for an engaging user experience.
